This is a portfolio website for a CS student focused on gamedev. Use React, TypeScript, and Vite. Use the colors 'Space cadet' (#1d1b42) and 'Flax' (#dfd390). Add cool entry animations and scroll-triggered effects using a popular animation library. The site should feel modern and interactive, with placeholder sections for gamedev projects and CS content.
